# Infinite-Numbers
Infinite capacity integer

I planed to program a rational as well, but didn't get to it in time I wanted to.

I realize this has already been done, but I wanted to see if I could do it without references after 1 semester (now 3) of C++.  (References as in existing extended integers, not C++ references.)

Note on O() listings:  Escape conditions aren't considered in best case listing, they should all be between O(1) and O(best) and therefore be negligable.
